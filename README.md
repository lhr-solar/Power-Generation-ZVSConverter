# Power-Generation-ZVSConverter
Power converter hardware design for next-gen MPPT. 
Largely based on a design made by Alex Hanson, outlined in this article:

Ishaan added the description which has nothing to do with the project and I can't change it. :3

TODO:  
  Refine cap values  
  Find max frequency that can support needed boosting  
  Characterize duty cycle effect on output voltage

Note: The "Reader" script will play a sound on completion. Don't be alarmed by it.
