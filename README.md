# Power-Generation-ZVSConverter
Power converter hardware design for next-gen MPPT. 
Largely based on a design made by Alex Hanson, outlined in this article:
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7749103/footnotes#footnotes-id-fn9

Ishaan added the description which has nothing to do with the project and I can't change it. :3

TODO:  
  Select opamps  
  Select gate driver/isolated converter  
  Check if nucleo DAC is sufficient. If not then add external DAC.  
  

Note: The "Reader" script will play a sound on completion. Don't be alarmed by it.
